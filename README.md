# Python Exposure

## Kattis Folder
#### I attempt some kattis questions in python but because my main language is c++, my code may not be as good.

## Data Analytics folder
#### During my summer break in 2018, I went for a python course to learn python and basic data analytics such as CSV files, wordcloud and matplotlib. I am missing quite a bit of code done in the course, so here is all that's left.

## Artificial Intelligence
#### Learning some tutorials online to understand more about AI and machine learning.

## Django
#### Even though I've written in Html, CSS and Javascript, I am trying to learn python better so i am learning from online tutorials on how to make a website in python. Further, this allows me to understand full stack frameworks.
